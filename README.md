# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This is where I'll be documenting my journey through the coding challenges of this year's event.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual set of programming puzzles that are released daily in December. Participants solve these puzzles using code, often learning new techniques and improving their problem-solving skills along the way.

## Goals

- **Improve problem-solving skills**: Each puzzle presents unique challenges.
- **Learn new concepts**: Use this opportunity to experiment with different algorithms and data structures.
- **Have fun!**: Enjoy the festive challenge.

## Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- **`DXX/`**: Each folder corresponds to a day (e.g., `D01` for December 1st) and contains:
  - `input.txt`: The puzzle input for that day.
  - `index.ts`: My solution written in TypeScript.
  - `README.md`: Notes or explanations for that day’s challenge and solution.

## Running the Solutions

To run a solution:

1. Navigate to the respective day’s directory.
2. Install dependency's:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the solution:

   ```bash
   ts-node solution.ts
   ```

## Contact

Feel free to reach out if you’d like to discuss solutions, share ideas, or provide feedback.

## Disclaimer

These solutions reflect my personal approach and might not be the most optimized or elegant. Constructive feedback is always welcome!
