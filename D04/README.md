# Part One

got stuck for a while as i cant wrap my head around 2d arrays and had to figure out a good way to recusivly find the correct word

# Part Two

Thaught of doing it like the first part, but Could not figure out how i would check for the X-formation.

Then i saw that in the center it wil always be an 'A' so i just needed to check the corners wich i did with a disgustingly long if statement :)
